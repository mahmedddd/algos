Depth First Search (DFS): Time Complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

Breadth First Search (BFS): Time Complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

Time Complexity: O((V + E) log V), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. The log V factor arises from the priority queue operations in the algorithm.
